							<h2>Front-End Developer at Insteo, Inc.</h2>
							<h3>August 2015 – Current</h3>
							
							<p>Worked with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develop websites and
							apps for clients with digital signage needs. Used Photoshop and
							Illustrator to extract components from mock-ups provided by clients
							to convert these mock-ups into interactive websites. Created general
							apps not meant for a specific client but were instead displayed
							in the Insteo store for potential customers to purchase. Dealt
							a lot with JSON because data returned from an AJAX call was always
							sent in the form of JSON, which needed to be iterated through 
							correctly. Used CSS animations to make the various digital signage
							apps more dynamic and eye-catching. Clients would usually receive
							our product through a link, but often times they sent over a media
							player that needed to be set up to automatically display our app
							when turned on.
