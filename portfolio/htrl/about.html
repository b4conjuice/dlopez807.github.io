					<p>The facilities that Electronic Inventory Online operates are optimized for the rapid receiving, evaluation, and resale of product
					whether new or used.  The size and scope of each facility allow us to combine all of the services required to handle reverse logistics,
					asset recovery and product distribution under one roof.   Our enterprise-grade software solutions allow us to monitor and track
					merchandise from delivery to shipment.  Where some of our reverse logistics consignment partners prefer to maximize ROI through the slow
					sale of merchandise at top dollar, other customers do not have such luxury and require immediate sale of their product; our long-term
					storage ability and sales networks allow us to cater to each of these needs equally and as preferred.
					</p>

					<p>Electronic Inventory Online markets and distributes our customers’ and our merchandise across multiple e-commerce marketplaces
					worldwide.  In addition to our website and primary sales and distribution platform www.eio.com, our business markets as required and
					preferred across various 3rd party merchant marketplaces including Amazon.com, Ebay.com, Rakuten.com (formerly Buy.com), and Bestbuy.com.
					</p>					

					<p>Electronic Inventory Online employs various enterprise software solutions to ensure the highest possible efficiency in handling 
					merchandise, translating into the highest possible service experience and customer satisfaction of our customers.  As such, any action
					taken on the premises is able to be quantified and analyzed to ensure that we are operating at maximum possible efficiency, whether it be
					processing time for inbound orders, time on call per customer, resolution time for resolving customer issues, or anything in-between.
					</p>

					<p>Electronic Inventory Online has diversified in such a way that any shift or loss of any particular market segment will have no
					catastrophic influence on the company as a whole; diversified across commerce channels, customers serviced, and products and services
					offered, our business is able to adapt to ever-changing market conditions to ensure the highest level of service to our customers.
					Additionally, Electronic Inventory Online prides itself on its ability to identify and predict changes in market conditions and make
					adjustments accordingly to minimize effects.  We pride ourselves on the ability to identify gaps and opportunities in market segments
					and expand rapidly to full the needs of a constantly-changing customer and product base. 
					</p>

					<p>Electronic Inventory Online has tested and proven experience offering reverse logistics, asset management and asset recovery
					to various private and multinational corporations, including but not limited to Sony Corporation (SNE), Belden CDT Inc. (BDC),
					Steren Electronics International, and Belkin International, Inc.   In addition to our knowledge and history in these areas, as a
					merchant seller on the Amazon.com marketplace Electronic Inventory Online has unique and indispensable insight into the mindset and
					expectations of the typical Amazon.com buyer, the volume of product involved and the disposition of said product once returned.
					</p>

					<p>Electronic Inventory Online would benefit greatly from the influx of merchandise from Amazon.com/warehouse deals, and would
					be proud to include Amazon.com in its portfolio of Reverse Logistics customers. 
					</p>

					<p>Regardless of many years of experience and qualifications in the Reverse Logistics and Asset Recovery industry, Electronic
					Inventory Online is simply not equipped to fully satisfy the complete spectrum of Amazon.com’s RL/AR needs due to the sheer 
					volume of units in question.  However, Electronic Inventory Online is a rapidly expanding corporation with proven experience 
					and success in the industry, and can become a valuable supplemental asset to Amazon.com’s existing reverse supply chain.  Our 
					trained diagnostics and repair specialists have experience working with a wide range of products from consumer to professional
					electronics, personal computers, electronics-related toys, video games and DVD/Blu-Ray. 
					</p>

					<p>Electronic Inventory Online understands that, as our business has been built on insight and experiences working with unique
					customers with unique product in unique scenarios, so has our competitor’s businesses evolved the same way.  As such, it is 
					impossible to compare or quantify our business to that of any other.  
					</p>

					<p>Electronic Inventory Online ultimately does not employ any services, technology, or assets that cannot be acquired or
					employed by any other company.  Our business stands apart from others in employing the hardest-working and most dedicated 
					staff constantly striving to exceed the needs and expectations of our customers, and ensure that every of our diverse range of
					customers is completely satisfied.   Our customers are able to use our services and trust that, whatever the disposition of
					their product, we can maximize ROI.
					</p>

					<p>Electronic Inventory Online is currently active in secondary retail marketplaces as required by the needs of our customers,
					including but not limited to all aforementioned e-commerce marketplaces in which Electronic Inventory Online is affiliated.
